# Excel-Files-with-python
The following code is inspired by a Udemy course presented by Mr "Frank Anemaet". Here you can find his Udemy courses link : https://www.udemy.com/user/frank-anemaet/
# The course title is : Excel files with Python 
a brief course that explains how to uload and retrieve data from an excel file using a Python's library "openpyxl" 
I highly recommend watching the course which lasts for a total of 31 mins, which also gives you the chance to get the Udemy Certificate.
## In the last section of the Notebook: 
I executed a brief exercice where I insert structured data (Tabular data) and unstructured data (image) into the excel file. 
Because i didn't want to use any company's logo, I googled an useed logo.
